# Flashcard App

## About

This is a CRUD application that helps you study with flashcards. This project helped me to reinforce my skills and knowledge in using React and Bootstrap.

## Features And How To Use This App

This application allows you to create, read, edit, and delete decks and cards. The home page shows a list of decks, allowing you to create, view, study, or delete a deck. When you click on 'Create Deck,' the 'Create Deck' page will open and you can submit a new deck, if cancel is clicked, you are taken back to the home page. After submitting a new deck you are taken to the 'View' deck screen. From here you are able to edit, study (if there are at least 3 cards in the deck) and delete the deck as well as add, edit, delete any cards in the deck. If you're looking at a deck with cards the cards will be listed here. Anytime delete is clicked, a prompt will display to ensure a delete is wanted. On the "study" page, the front of the card will show the question you created and clicking flip will show the back of the card for the answer.
